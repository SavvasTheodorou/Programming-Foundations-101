# Take everything you've learned so far and build a mortgage calculator (or car payment calculator -- it's the same thing).

# You'll need three pieces of information:

# the loan amount
# the Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
# the loan duration
# From the above, you'll need to calculate the following two things:

# monthly interest rate
# loan duration in months
# You can then use the formula described here: http://www.mtgprofessor.com/formulas.htm

# Finally, don't forget to run your code through Rubocop.

# Hints:

# Figure out what format your inputs need to be in. For example, should the interest rate be expressed as 5 or .05, if you mean 5% interest?
# If you're working with Annual Percentage Rate (APR), you'll need to convert that to a monthly interest rate.
# Be careful about the loan duration -- are you working with months or years? Choose variable names carefully to assist in remembering.
